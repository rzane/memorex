# Memosa ðŸ¥‚

Memosa is a simple solution for caching method return values in Ruby.

Memosa is designed with the following features in mind:

* Fully compatible with Sorbet.
* Support for memoizing methods on frozen objects.
* Support for preloading and resetting memoized values.
* Support for memoization of class and module methods.
* Support for inheritance of memoized class and instance methods.
* No support for memoization of methods with arguments, which is a feature, not a bug.
* Provides RuboCop rules to ensure consistent usage.
* Provides RBI definitions for Sorbet users.
* Provides RBS definitions for Steep users.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add memosa
```

## Usage

To memoize a method, simply extend the class with `Memosa` and use the `memoize` decorator.

```ruby
class User
  extend Memosa

  memoize def id
    SecureRandom.uuid
  end
end

user = User.new
user.id # => "ea16e391-20c2-477a-b393-691633a6483f"
user.id # => "ea16e391-20c2-477a-b393-691633a6483f"
```

Memosa can also memoize class methods:

```ruby
class Configuration
  class << self
    extend Memosa

    memoize def instance
      new(YAML.load_file("config.yml"))
    end
  end
end
```

### `Memosa::API`

To access the cache directly, include `Memosa::API`.

```ruby
class User
  extend Memosa
  include Memosa::API
  # ... etc ...
end

user = User.new
user.memosa # => #<Memosa::Cache>

user.memosa.merge!(id: SecureRandom.id)
user.memosa.delete(:id)
user.memosa.clear
```

### `Memosa.reset`

Memosa provides a `reset` method for resetting the cache, but `Memosa::API#clear` should be preferred.

```ruby
user = User.new
user.id # => "ea16e391-20c2-477a-b393-691633a6483f"

Memosa.reset(user)
user.id # => "4690993f-408f-4b7a-824b-c6776782b2fd"
```

## RuboCop

Memosa provides some RuboCop rules to ensure that you're using it correctly.

Add the following configuration to your `.rubocop.yml` file:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  memosa: config/rubocop.yml
```

## ActiveRecord

If you're using ActiveRecord, you might want to ensure that Memosa caches are flushed whenever
the record is reloaded.

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  def reload
    super
    Memosa.reset(self)
  end
end
```

## The name?

I'm glad you asked. All credit goes to [@devinburnette](https://github.com/devinburnette).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
